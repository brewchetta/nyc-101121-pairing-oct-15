// Challenge One
// Create a new array with only the movie titles. You can use one of these methods to do it: `.filter`, `.map`, `.reduce`, `.sort`. Which one did you use and why?

// Challenge Two
// Use `.find` in order to find the first movie made after 1980. Use `.filter` to find every movie made after 1980. What's the difference between `.find` and `.filter`?

// Challenge Three
// Use `.filter` to get an array of movies where Sigourney Weaver was a cast member.

// BONUS
// Write code that finds the average runtime for the movies.
